I installed OS X 10.6, which apparently defaults to compiling
everything for 64 bit, and I'm still running a 32-bit build of
Pd-extended.  So, trying to compile the latest iemguts gave me
"Mach-o, but wrong architecture" when trying to load the now 64-bit
compiled externals.

The trick is to add -m32 to the CFLAGS and -arch i386 to the LDFLAGS
in the Makefile to force gcc back to 32-bit mode (well, or use a
64-bit Pd but that's for another day).
